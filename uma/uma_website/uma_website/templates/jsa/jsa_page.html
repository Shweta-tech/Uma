<h1 text-align="center">UMA-WCD-CTARA Joint workshop-training program for JSA schemes</h1>

<br><h3 text-align="center">Project Description</h3><br>

<p>Background: UMA aims to build public knowledge network of colleges by capacity building to perform as key player in development sector. Sector-specific workshops aim to create a network of colleges that can work in planning, design, monitoring, evaluation and assessments of government programs. <br><br>
The Workshop: Jalyukta shivar abhiyan assessment workshop was organized by CTARA in collaboration with and sponsored by Water Conservation Department (WCD) of Government of Maharashtra (GoM).  A two days workshop held at Prof. Ram Meghe Institute of Technology And Research Badnera, Amravati on 4th and 5th February 2018. Finally, a two day follow-up workshop held on 5th-6th July 2018 in MIT, Aurangabad. </p>

<p>The objective of the first round of training program was to build the capacities of Engineering college teachers and students in monitoring and evaluation of JSA schemes in and around their taluka assigned which is aimed at strengthening the institutional capabilities of Department of Water and Soil conservation, Government of Maharashtra for enhanced and more comprehensive approach towards the existing as well as upcoming JSA schemes. The training focused on the following components: <br><br>
<ul>Extension: Development of UMA institutes as public knowledge infrastructure accessible to public e. g Ability to work as Third Party Audit agency.<br>Teaching: Enabling effective guidance of student in development sector<br>Research: Exposure and simulation towards emerging issue in development sector specially watershed management, cropping patterns and the intervention structures so as to harness the full potential of rainwater.</ul></p>

<p> Each College participated for the workshop involved 2 nodal professors and 2 students. Each of the participating colleges have to undertake assessment of JSA villages in a taluka in their respective district and prepare report. The taluka will be assigned by the WCD. TDSC at CTARA will provide the necessary hand holding and technical support to the colleges.</p>
